**Coding Guidelines**

1. Early return if's (Don't do too many if else, rather use if and return in functions if possible.)
2. Function to be made:<br>
   2.1. A lot of things are being done in one function.<br>
   2.2. Reusable code to be put in functions.

3. Variable names: registrationApi
4. File names: Modules should be named as : RegistrationApi.js
5. Try to use var/let as less as possible. Use const as much as you can.
